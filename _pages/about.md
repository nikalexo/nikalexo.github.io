As of February 2024, I am an MSCA postdoctoral fellow at Prof. Spinellis' [Business Analytics Laboratory](https://www.balab.aueb.gr) of the [Athens University of Economics and Business](https://www.aueb.gr/en). My MSCA project is [SPUCS](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101108713), aiming to provide users more control over their smart devices via transparency mechanisms and novel software architectures. Before joining AUEB, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Telecooperation Lab of TU Darmstadt, Germany, where I had previously become a Dr.-Ing. with my dissertation titled [New Approaches to Software Security Metrics and Measurements](https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/21520/1/diss_finalfinal.pdf). I am interested in all aspects of computer security and privacy, with a focus on metrics and measurements of software security, anonymous communication systems, and decentralized computing. For more information about me you can take a look at my [CV](https://www.alexopoulos.ch/files/CV.pdf).

If you are a student interested to do research on the topics above do not hesitate to contact me. A list of open project topics is available [here](https://www.alexopoulos.ch/files/topics.pdf).
